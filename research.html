      <h2>Field work</h2>
      <p>
        As an Amazonian born and raised, my research focuses on Amazonian fauna
        and my field work experience.

      <h2>Museum</h2>
      <p>
        Differences in plumage coloration is one of the main features utilized
        in Ornithology to describe and recognize species. Birds are among the
        most colorful vertebrates and this high diversity occur because birds
        can produce colors both by pigments (melanin and carotenoids that
        creates colors like black, grays, browns, reds, orange and yellow) but
        also structural colors. Some examples of structural colors in plumage
        include blue, iridescence and super-black. I use spectrometry to measure
        reflectance from Museum specimens.

      <h2>Electron Microscopy</h2>
      <p>
        The basics of electron Microscopy starts with a stream of high voltage
        electrons (primary electrons) discharged by what we will call “electron
        source” or “electron gun” in a vacuum chamber towards the specimen.
        Tungsten filament in a light bulb is often used as the source of
        electron for EM. The microscope chamber is in a vacuum to avoid
        interaction between the beam of electrons with other air molecules. When
        the stream touches the sample, some interaction between specimen and
        electrons occurs, that can be detected and is transformed into an image.
        And this is where the two methods will change once more. In SEM, a
        secondary stream of electrons is emitted from this interaction with the
        specimen back and they are attracted to a detector and converted into an
        image. In TEM, the electron bean will be transmitted through the
        specimen to a fluorescent screen where it is photographed using film or
        a camera. Specimen thickness will allow or not the electron to pass to
        the Imaging System. Some electrons pass the specimen with some loss of
        energy and will therefore be reflected as some shades of gray
        accordingly. The more energy is past through the specimen, the lighter
        it will be reflected in the fluorescent screen. Electrons that are lost
        with the impact with the specimen (due to its thickness) will not be
        reflected in the reflective screen and will be shown as darker gray. For
        SEM the specimen needs to have a conductive surface that will interact
        with the electrons. We obtain that by coating the sample with a super
        thin layer of a metal such as platinum or gold
      </p>

      <h3><st>EM and Transmission EM</em> </h3>
      <p>
        I use both SEM and TEM to study structures that creates colors. SEM is
        used to study three dimensions features of specimens such as the feather
        features that cause the low reflectance in black plumages (super black).
        These features are in the outer layers of the feathers (e. g. barbule
        shape). The nano structures that create non-iridescent structural blue
        plumage are in the medullary layers in feathers barbs. I use TEM to
        access these structures. TEM requires that sample is embedded in resin
        and sliced into a very thin slide using a diamond knife.
