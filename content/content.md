I am a Brazilian Evolutionary Biologist and a PhD candidate at Louisiana State University. I study evolution of plumage coloration, with a focus in structural colors. For my research I employ a combination of techniques that includes Spectrometry, Electron Microscopy and Molecular Data.

Field work

As an Amazonian born and raised, my research focuses on Amazonian fauna and my field work experience.

Museum

Differences in plumage coloration is one of the main features utilized in Ornithology to describe and recognize species. Birds are among the most colorful vertebrates and this high diversity occur because birds can produce colors both by pigments (melanin and carotenoids that creates colors like black, grays, browns, reds, orange and yellow) but also structural colors. Some examples of structural colors in plumage include blue, iridescence and super-black.

I use spectrometry to measure reflectance from Museum specimens.

Electron Microscopy

The basics of electron Microscopy starts with a stream of high voltage electrons (primary electrons) discharged by what we will call “electron source” or “electron gun” in a vacuum chamber towards the specimen. Tungsten filament in a light bulb is often used as the source of electron for EM. The microscope chamber is in a vacuum to avoid interaction between the beam of electrons with other air molecules. When the stream touches the sample, some interaction between specimen and electrons occurs, that can be detected and is transformed into an image. And this is where the two methods will change once more. In SEM, a secondary stream of electrons is emitted from this interaction with the specimen back and they are attracted to a detector and converted into an image. In TEM, the electron bean will be transmitted through the specimen to a fluorescent screen where it is photographed using film or a camera. Specimen thickness will allow or not the electron to pass to the Imaging System. Some electrons pass the specimen with some loss of energy and will therefore be reflected as some shades of gray accordingly. The more energy is past through the specimen, the lighter it will be reflected in the fluorescent screen. Electrons that are lost with the impact with the specimen (due to its thickness) will not be reflected in the reflective screen and will be shown as darker gray.

For SEM the specimen needs to have a conductive surface that will interact with the electrons. We obtain that by coating the sample with a super thin layer of a metal such as platinum or gold

Scanning EM and Transmission EM
I use both SEM and TEM to study structures that creates colors.

SEM is used to study three dimensions features of specimens such as the feather features that cause the low reflectance in black plumages (super black). These features are in the outer layers of the feathers (e. g. barbule shape).

The nano structures that create non-iridescent structural blue plumage are in the medullary layers in feathers barbs. I use TEM to access these structures. TEM requires that sample is embedded in resin and sliced into a very thin slide using a diamond knife.
